<h1>Ember Component Sandbox - V9</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This repo contains a working Ember.js project used to support a tutorial on Ember.js components</p>
<h2>What's here</h2>
<p>These code examples are based on "Ember.js Cookbook" Chapter 6, "Using events in components".</p>
<p>The key changes are that property and function names have been changed to make more explicit the dependencies between the elements that make up the component.</p>
<h2>Component Use Example</h2>
<div id="demooutput">
  <h3>Student List</h3>
  {{student-list abcDef=(action 'removeController1' ) ghiJkl=(action 'resetController1')}}
    {{#each model as |student|}}
      <p>{{student}}</p>
    {{/each}}
</div>
{{outlet}}
