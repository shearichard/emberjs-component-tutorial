This repo contains a working Ember.js project used to support a tutorial on Ember.js components.

These code examples are based on "Ember.js Cookbook" Chapter 6, "Using events in components".

The key changes are that property and function names have been changed to make more explicit the dependencies between the elements that make up the component.

This project was developed on the 3.8 release of Ember.js.
